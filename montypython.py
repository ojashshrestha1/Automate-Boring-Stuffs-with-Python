print('I am a Computer Engineer by education, software developer my profession and a scientist my heart.

But on domain that captivates me is History. So during the programming journey in my life, I have always been inspired by the history of the lives of the men and women, their stories that influenced in the course of programming.


Giving a bit more introduction of mine, I have worked as a full stack developer professionally now for 3 years now and Python is one of my favourite language not simply for how amazing it is and the possibilities and flexiblity it has but how it has changed the course of my life too.

So getting back to explaining you how History has influenced my way of learning, I want to explain to you of the Book must of us have had read while learning Python. Its not necesaary that we all have read it, but there was something on Chapter.... Line .... of the book.

It was about this word SPAM. I never had imagined how the world came into existence while this study of my life changed the way I thought of how much even Programming language are influenced by day to day live TV Series. Yes you heard it right.

Their sketch show has been referred to as "not only one of the more enduring icons of 1970s British popular culture, but also an important moment in the evolution of television comedy.
